                  Chandler: The problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know? I mean, we're in the car, we're fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake.
                  Rachel: Yeah, well, word of advice: Bring back the comedian. Otherwise next time you're gonna find yourself sitting at home, listening to that album alone.

                  Monica: Oh I’m working on my toast for the party, or as I like to call it. Sob fest 2002. Hey check this out. (Hands him a picture.)
                  Chandler: It’s a dog.
                  Monica: It’s a dead dog. That’s Chi-Chi; she died when I was in high school.

                  Phoebe 想摆脱意外获得的 1000 美元，找到拾荒者 Lizzie
                  Phoebe: Hey, Lizzie.
                  Lizzie: Hey, Weird Girl.
                  Phoebe: I brought you alphabet soup.
                  Lizzie: Did you pick out the vowels?
                  Phoebe: Yes. But I left in the Ys. 'Cause, y'know, "sometimes y". Uh, I also have something else for you. (She searches in her purse.)

                  这里的 "sometimes y" 指的是？

                  首先这里的 alphabet soup 是一种字母形的意大利面，如下图所示：

                  "sometimes y" 指的是 y 在一些时候被算作元音，一些时候不被算作元音，因此 Phoebe 没有将 y 形状的面挑出。

                  Ross: You know, there's nothing wrong with speaking correctly.
                  Rachel: "Indeed there isn't"... I should really get back to work.
                  Phoebe: Yeah, 'cause otherwise someone might get what they actually ordered.

                  "The hair comes out" 字面义是把头发放下来；"The gloves come on" 字面义是把手套脱下。两句话描述的
                  是在打架前做的准备活动，意指要大战一场了。

                  "deja vu" 来自于法语，指的是眼下的场景似曾相似的现象。这里暗指 Monica 又要和约会对象分手了。
