                  Barry: Careful! They haven't quite taken yet.
                  Rachel: And you've got lenses! But you hate sticking your finger in your eye!

                  Monica: What you guys don't understand is, for us, kissing is as important as any part of it.
                  Joey: Yeah, right!.......Y'serious?
                  Phoebe: Oh, yeah!
                  Rachel: Everything you need to know is in that first kiss.
                  Monica: Absolutely.
                  Chandler: Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out.
                  Ross: Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket.
                  Chandler: The problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know? I mean, we're in the car, we're fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake.
                  Rachel: Yeah, well, word of advice: Bring back the comedian. Otherwise next time you're gonna find yourself sitting at home, listening to that album alone.
