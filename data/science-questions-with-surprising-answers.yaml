    displayName: Do blind people dream in visual images?
    brief: >-
      Yes, blind people do indeed dream in visual images. For people who were
      born with eyesight and then later went blind, it is not surprising that
      they experience visual sensations while dreaming.

                  Dreams are drawn from memories that are stored in the brain.
                  People born blind without any problems in their brains can
                  have visual images in their dreams.

                  In the few cases where blindness results from problems in the
                  brain, the person usually regains some amount of vision due to
                  brain plasticity
