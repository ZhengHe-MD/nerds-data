                  Just to reminds you the characteristics of effective response items:
                  - Ensure that every response is grammatically consistent with the stem
                  - Make sure response items have a parallel grammatical structure
                  - Avoid idioms and potentially confusing vocabulary
                  - Avoid absolutes (e.g., always and never)
                  - Make sure the position of the correct answer varies
                  - Make the length of response items roughly consistent
                  - Eliminate repetitive or extraneous wording
                  - Ensure that all items are mutually exclusive (i.e., avoid overlapping alternatives)
                  - List response options in a logical order (e.g., alphabetically, chronologically, or numerically)
                  - Avoid potentially confusing response items such as “A and B” or “B and C.”
                  If there is more than one correct answer, use multiple-answer questions instead
                  - Avoid using all of the above and none of the above, but if you do use them,
                  use them generously and not just when they’re the correct answer.

                  The grammatical structure is obviously parallel, even the lengths of them.

                  Don't forget the feedback for each response and distractor,
                  it's a chance that you can help the audience understand the
